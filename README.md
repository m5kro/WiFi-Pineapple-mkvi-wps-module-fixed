The wps module for the WiFi Pineapple nano and tetra. It has been edited by m5kro (aka kraken5) to run properly on the latest firmwares. If dependencies don't install correctly use the main branch with the ipks.

After downloading, place the wps folder in either /pineapple/modules or /sd/modules. Once the files are there, reboot the pineapple. Then at the web interface go to the wps module and install dependencies.
