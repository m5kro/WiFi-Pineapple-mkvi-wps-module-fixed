# WiFi Pineapple nano and tetra wps module fixed

To Do:<br>
add oneshot functionality<br>
fix error 161<br>

The wps module for the WiFi Pineapple nano and tetra. It has been edited by m5kro (aka kraken5) to run properly on the latest firmwares.  Thanks to Whistle Master for the original and adde88 for the updated reaver, bully, and pixiewps ipks.

After downloading, place the wps folder in either /pineapple/modules or /sd/modules. Once the files are there, reboot the pineapple. Then at the web interface go to the wps module and install dependencies.

After pressing the install dependencies button you may choose to delete the ipks to free up space if needed. ipks are stored in "/pineapple/modules/wps/ipks/" or "/sd/modules/wps/ipks/" depending on where you chose to install.
